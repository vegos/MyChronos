    It appears to be inlineable (size = 50 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	get_numberOfDays() (1 times)

extern void display_date() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 5 non-trivial scope blocks nested 4 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	display_symbol() (5 times)
	switch_seg() (14 times)
	display_chars() (9 times)
	int_to_array() (4 times)

extern unsigned char get_numberOfDays() is called from 2 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 64 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void mx_date() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 197 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	get_numberOfDays() (1 times)
	set_value() (5 times)
	display_symbol() (1 times)
	display_chars() (4 times)
	int_to_array() (4 times)
	clear_display_all() (1 times)

extern void reset_date() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 13 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void sx_date() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 38 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>


These functions may be recursive:
	display_date()
	mx_date()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	clear_display_all()
	set_value()
	int_to_array()
	display_chars()
	switch_seg()
	display_symbol()

to share stack space among distinct scoping blocks.  References
in the source interlisting will look like "O$1.s3_1.l3_2" or "&$O$O1+0".
